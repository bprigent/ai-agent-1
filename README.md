# Repository Dedicated to AI Agent building

I am joining the HF course to build AI agents. This will be where I will store my code. This is also a way for me to learn how to use the cursor IDE.

Here is the course [link](https://huggingface.co/learn/agents-course/unit0/introduction)


## Tasks
- Added IA rules into cursor
- Added docs to cursor
- downloaded smolagents (python 10 is required)
